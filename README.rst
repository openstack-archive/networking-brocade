   1. VDX 67xx series of switches

Configuration

In order to use this mechnism the brocade configuration file needs to be edited with the appropriate
configuration information:

        % cat /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_brocade.ini
        [switch]
        username = admin
        password = password
        address  = <switch mgmt ip address>
        ostype   = NOS

Additionally the brocade mechanism driver needs to be enabled from the ml2 config file:

       % cat /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini

       [ml2]
       tenant_network_types = vlan
       type_drivers = local,flat,vlan,gre,vxlan
       mechanism_drivers = brocade
